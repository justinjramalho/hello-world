Anything typed after a hashtag and/or three quotation
will be ignored by the Python Interpreter
(not exactly 'ignored')
but it is incredibly important for organized
and clear comments, when working with a team
for programming – think bigger scope – think documentation,
like in medicine, or teaching (test grades, misbehavior, etc.)
